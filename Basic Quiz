# Basic Quiz Game

# Create a list of questions and answers:
questions = [
    "Which data structure in Python is used to store a collection of items in an ordered way?",
    "What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?",
    "Which keyword is used to define a function in Python?",
    "What is the output of the following code: print(type(5 + 5.0))"
]

answers = [
    "list",
    "Tuples are immutable, while lists are mutable",
    "def",
    "float"
]

score = 0

# Iterate through the questions and answers:
for i in range(len(questions)):
    print(questions[i])
    user_answer = input("Your answer: ")
    
    if user_answer.lower() == answers[i].lower():
        print("Correct!")
        score += 1
    else:
        print("Incorrect.")
    
    print()
    
#Display the final score after all questions are answered.

print(f"Your final score is {score} out of {len(questions)}.")
